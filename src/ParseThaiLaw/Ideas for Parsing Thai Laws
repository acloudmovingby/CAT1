Common errors: 
   
    (MODERATE) A single section number is mistyped.
        If it's not a valid Thai numeral, check to see if previous and next are okay, then just interpolate

    (HARD) Somtimes a Section is not linebroken to properly.
        If a Section number jumps up by 2, go back in reverse and see if you can find the prior section 
        (make sure it's the correct number). This is dangerous of course cuz some clauses reference themselves.

    (EASY) Remove headers and footers
        If for a given file there is always headers and footers, assuming those phrases are 
        not in the law itself and are on their own line, you can delete.

    (HARD) Fix common OCR errors 
        Hard in that I have to figure out what those errors are and I have to use a dictionary to check.
