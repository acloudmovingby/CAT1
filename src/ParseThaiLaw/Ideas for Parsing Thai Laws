Common errors: 
   
    (EASY-MODERATE) errors with Section 193/1 formatting
        Easy because I could just ignore those parts for now. 
        Moderate because to really deal with it, I have to be able to compare and deal with those cases.
            Deal with by when checking Section header number, if ou find / then split
    
    (MODERATE) A single section number is mistyped.
        If it's not a valid Thai numeral, check to see if previous and next are okay, then just interpolate

    (HARD) Somtimes a Section is not linebroken to properly.
        If a Section number jumps up by 2, go back in reverse and see if you can find the prior section 
        (make sure it's the correct number). This is dangerous of course cuz some clauses reference themselves.

    (EASY) Remove headers and footers
        If for a given file there is always headers and footers, assuming those phrases are 
        not in the law itself and are on their own line, you can delete.

    (VERY HARD) Fix common OCR errors 
        Hard in that I have to figure out what those errors are and I have to use a dictionary to check.

    (HARD) Catch "section" or "มาตรา" being mispelled
    if it has a smlal edit distance away from Section or มาตรา, assume it's one of those
