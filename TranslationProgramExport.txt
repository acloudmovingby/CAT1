Dear Parents,
The youth of the nation are the resources of great value to their country. Our school aims to develop our students into people of character, namely to prepare them physically, mentally, emotionally, socially and intellectually, to develop awareness of their role, to be responsible, including respecting the rules and other practices of school and society. This shall help the child engage the rest of society with joy. 
The school loves and cares for its students, your children. For this reason we kindly ask for your cooperation in keeping an eye on their behavior and learning while at home, while also providing educational support as possible. We hope that the students try to develop their capabilities both academically and ethically, and are the pride of their family and school going forward. As such, the school shall tend to the student similarly while they are at school. 
This Individual Learning Development Report, no. PorPhor6, is a document for communication between you and the school with some information about the student. It includes 4 important matters: the registrar history, health information, educational and professional goals, and academic review and feedback regarding the student's behavior while at school and home. This information serves to give the student a correct understanding of their situation so as to help them make adjustments or for further support. We thus kindly ask that you take the time to consider whether this information and assessments ring true. Your own assessments  and opinions are of great help to the student and their homeroom teacher in their evaluation of the student as per our school motto, "Academically outstanding and assertive."
At this time we'd like to express our deep gratitude for your cooperation for the benefit of your child.
